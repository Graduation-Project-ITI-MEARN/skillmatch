## 🎯 Overview

**SkillMatch AI** is an innovative talent assessment and hiring platform that transforms how companies evaluate candidates. Instead of traditional résumé screening, companies post real-world challenges across any digital field (development, design, data science, marketing). Candidates submit solutions along with video explanations, and our AI evaluates both the technical quality and the candidate's understanding.

### The Problem We Solve

-  **For Companies:** Wasting time on unqualified applicants and making hiring decisions based on credentials rather than capability
-  **For Candidates:** Struggling to prove skills without experience, and facing bias in traditional hiring processes

### Our Solution

1. Companies post real-world tasks instead of job descriptions
2. Candidates solve challenges and record video explanations of their approach
3. AI analyzes both the solution quality AND video explanation to verify understanding
4. Top performers move to interviews, while all participants gain portfolio-worthy work
